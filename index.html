<h2><a href="https://github.com/YangMizzou/Simultaneous-Moving-Object-Moving-Transmitter-Localization-with-Unknown-Offsets" target="_blank">Simultaneous Moving Object Moving Transmitter Localization with Unknown Offsets</a></h2>

<p><li> Investigated the multistatic localization of a moving object in position and velocity using an uncoordinated moving transmitter.<br></li>
   <li> The measurements are time delays and frequencies and each kind is subject to an unknown amount of offset.<br></li>
   <li> Derived the condition about the localization geometry that can eliminate the degradation due to the offsets.<br> </li> 
   <li> Developed algebraic solution to simultaneously localize the moving object and transmitter that can reach the CRLB accuracy.<br></li>
   <li> Examined the particular case of having time delay measurements only and devised the optimal geometry.</li></p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/YangMizzou/Simultaneous-Target-and-Transmitter-Localization" target="_blank">Simultaneous Target and Transmitter Localization</a></h2>

<p><li> Investigated the object localization in the absence of the transmitter position.<br></li>
   <li> Examined the performance improvement compared to the TDOA technique.<br></li>
   <li> Developed algebraic closed-form solution for the nonlinear problem of simulataneous target and transmitter localization.<br></li>
   <li> Derived the optimum receiver placement in the absence of transmitter position.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/YangMizzou/Elliptic-or-Hyperbolic-Localization-Using-Minimum-Measurement-Solutions" target="_blank">Elliptic or Hyperbolic Localization Using Minimum Measurement Solutions</a></h2>

<p><li> Derived a new algebraic positioning solution using minimum number of measurements.<br></li>
   <li> Reduced the computation to the roots of a quadratic equation.<br></li>
   <li> Developed an outlier detector based on graph processing.<br></li>
   <li> Proposed a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) to form the final location estimate that can reach the CRLB accuracy.<br></li>
   <li> Developed a measurement partitioning scheme to improve the performance when the noise level becomes large.</p>
